<h1>Part 1 of 3</h1>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>In this section of the experiment, you'll listen to someone saying two versions of the same sentence. We'll ask you to decide how the two versions sound different.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Don't think too hard about your answer -- just go with your instinct!</li>
	<br />
	<li>If you can't decide or can't tell a difference, just make your best guess.</li>
</ul>
