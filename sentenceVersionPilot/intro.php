<h1> Linguistics Experiment </h1>

<p>In this experiment, you will partake in several tasks involving listening to sentences and words. You will be asked to give your opinion of people based on their voices, as well as answer a few questions about language. We will also ask you to read a list of words aloud and record them using your computer's microphone, so please make sure your computer can record sound.</p>

<p>The experiment will take about 15-20 minutes. You will be paid $2.50 for participating.</p>

<p>At the end of the experiment, we will ask a few short questions about you and your language background.</p>
