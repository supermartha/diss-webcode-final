<h1>Part 2 of 3</h1>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>In this section of the experiment, you'll hear some recordings. Some of the recordings will be of real words, and some will be of made-up words. Your task is to decide if you hear a real word, or a non-word.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Type <b>'r'</b> if you hear a <b>real word</b>.</li><br />
	<li>Type <b>'u'</b> if you hear a <b>non-word</b>.</li><br />
	<li>Some of the non-words will sound very similar to real words. For example, if you hear 'woman' pronounced as 'wooman', you should say it is a non-word.</li><br />
	<li>Try to respond as quickly as you can without making mistakes.</li>
</ul>
